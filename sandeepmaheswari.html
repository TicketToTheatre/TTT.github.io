            <b> EARLY LIFE AND FAMILY</b>
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Sandeep Maheshwari was born on 28 September 1980 in New Delhi. He was a reserved guy in school and did not have many friends in his school up to 10th standards. He was so low in self-esteem at that point of time that his positive thoughts used to be overpowered by negatives. 11th standard was the turning point of his when he met Neha (his wife). They both became friends and their trust in each other grew with time. After 12th, he starts his graduation at Kirori Mal College, but he could not complete his graduation because of some personal issues.
        </h2>
        <h2>The financial condition of his family was not good when he was just in the 9th standard. After the 12th exam, he started his first business as a Help Center to help 12th pass out students to choose their career and print many pamphlets with the title "What to do after 12th?"

            For this, he tied up with an institute called NIS- National Institute of Sales and Marketing. NIS offered Sandeep 20% commission if he referred the program of NIS to someone else. At NIS there were role plays, GD, presentations, and debates. It helped him interact with more and master his skills that helped him a lot in the long run.</h2>
